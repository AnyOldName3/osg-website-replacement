The OpenSceneGraph is an open source high performance 3D graphics toolkit, used by application developers in fields such as visual simulation, games, virtual reality, scientific visualization and modelling.
Written entirely in Standard C++ and OpenGL it runs on all Windows platforms, OSX, GNU/Linux, IRIX, Solaris, HP-Ux, AIX and FreeBSD operating systems.

The OpenSceneGraph is now well established as a robust scene graph technology, used widely in the vis-sim, space, scientific, oil-gas, games and virtual reality industries.
However, for new projects, we recommend the OSG's successor project, [VulkanSceneGraph](https://vsg-dev.github.io/vsg-dev.io/) for never-before-attainable performance and access to the latest hardware features with the same battle-tested DNA as the OSG.
