OpenMW is a Free and Open Source reimplementation of the engine of the hit 2002 role playing game *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*.
As well as aiming to support all features of the original engine (and eventually all its successors), OpenMW boasts a range of graphical improvements, including more modern shader effects, massive viewing distances, improved shadows and lighting, and a flexible post processing framework.

The project's website is [openmw.org](https://openmw.org/), and development happens on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw).

A third-party project to port OpenMW to the VulkanSceneGraph is underway [here](https://github.com/vsgopenmw-dev/vsgopenmw).
