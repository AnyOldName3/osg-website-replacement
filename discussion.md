[The OpenSceneGraph GitHub Discussion Forum](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/discussions) is available for community discussion.

Posts are organised into several categories:
* [Announcements](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/discussions/categories/announcements)
* [General](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/discussions/categories/general)
* [Ideas](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/discussions/categories/ideas)
* [Polls](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/discussions/categories/polls)
* [Q&A](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/discussions/categories/q-a)
* [Show and tell](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)

## Obsolete

Prior to GitHub Discussions, OpenSceneGraph-related discussions took place elsewhere.
* The OpenSceneGraph forums, which are no longer accessible.
* The OpenSceneGraph mailing list, history of which is available via [this archive](https://openscenegraph.github.io/OpenSceneGraphDotComBackup/OpenSceneGraph/lists.openscenegraph.org/pipermail/osg-users-openscenegraph.org/).
* The [OpenSceneGraph Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/osg-users).

There's a large corpus of past queries held within these, which may prove useful if you're having the same problem as someone else has in the past.
All three were nominally mirrored to each other, so searching in one should be as useful as searching in the other, although outages may mean some posts are missing.
Ironically, Google groups can be difficult to search, and the mailing list archive's search feature is no longer functioning since being moved to a static archive, so your mileage may vary.
