You should probably read [A Brief History of High-level APIs](https://vsg-dev.github.io/vsgTutorial/SettingTheScene/HighLevelAPIs#a-brief-history-of-high-level-apis) on the VulkanSceneGraph site.
This covers the years before the emergence of the OpenSceneGraph, its rise, and the changing conditions over the last several years leading to its eventual obsolescence.
