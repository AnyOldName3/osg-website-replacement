Before this website replaced its predecessor, an archive of the original site was created.
This is browsable using the links below.
Some subdomains (e.g. the forum and old trac site) were already non-functional when this archive was made, so are not included.

* [www.openscenegraph.com (equivalent to www.openscenegraph.org)](https://openscenegraph.github.io/OpenSceneGraphDotComBackup/OpenSceneGraph/www.openscenegraph.com/)
* [lists.openscenegraph.org/pipermail/osg-users-openscenegraph.org/](https://openscenegraph.github.io/OpenSceneGraphDotComBackup/OpenSceneGraph/lists.openscenegraph.org/pipermail/osg-users-openscenegraph.org/)

The archive is managed as a GitHub Pages site from [https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraphDotComBackup](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraphDotComBackup).

Some forum links may be manually resolvable by searching the GitHub repo for the post ID from the URL, or possibly the whole URL.
When posting to the forum, an equivalent post would automatically be sent to the mailing list, and would include a link back to the forum post.
These links should appear in a GitHub search.
