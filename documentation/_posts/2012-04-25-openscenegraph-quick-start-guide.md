This book is a concise introduction to OpenSceneGraph (OSG)---the open source, cross-platform scene graph application programmer interface (API).
OSG plays a key role in the 3D application software stack.
It's the middleware above the lower-level OpenGL hardware abstraction layer (HAL), providing extensive higher-level rendering, I/O, and spatial organization functionality to the 3D application.

The *Quick Start Guide* and *OpenSceneGraph Reference Manual* - ~~can now be purchased from their website [http://www.osgbooks.com](http://www.osgbooks.com/)~~ *this site is no longer operating*.
