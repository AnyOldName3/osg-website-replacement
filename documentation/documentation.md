## Doxygen

Doxygen docs are available [here]({% link documentation/doxygen.md %}).

## Guides

Some have been written, but most were so long ago that links have rotted and they didn't cover best-practice ten years ago.
Some can be accessed on the [old site archive]({% link archive.md %}).

## Books

Several books on using the OpenSceneGraph have been published.
See [the Books page]({% link documentation/books.md %}) for more information.
