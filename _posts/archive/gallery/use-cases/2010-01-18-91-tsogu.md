**EOR** history began with TGNGU On-line Education Center foundation at 1996. In 2006 it was reorganized to SRI of Electronic Educational Resources.


* Our institute supports on-line teaching technology, works out electronic complexes for methodic disciplines.


* Our electronic resources are used in TGNGU, its’ subsidiaries, Moscow universities, in many cities of Russia, abroad.


* Our computer lab works and simulators form and train professional skills and intuition, develop creative abilities, which increases an employee’ qualification.


+ Our workouts are designed to make lab practices in preliminary, secondary, and high schools, which makes more interesting to study as well as constant launching of new technologies allows familiarize to complex equipment in practice. VR systems so loved by all students take a dive into a midst of a favorite discipline.


Different technologies were learned and tried from the experience of ten years of computer laboratory works development and introduction. Cumulative experience allows to estimate the influence of different factors on the education effectiveness. Various technologies permit to form professional knowledge and skills, intuition and creative abilities in different ways.


Haskett consulting inc. (HCI) last research: “People remember 20% of that they see, 40% of that they see and hear and 70% that they see, hear and make”. The same facts were got in another Russian and foreign sources.


Memorization percent:


* Reading(text) - 10-30%;
* Eyesight(graphics) - 20-40%;
* Hearing and seeing(multimedia) - 30-50%;
* Speaking and writing(interactive) - 50-75%;

The point is that it is not possible to operate virtual object naturally if it has more degrees of freedom than the used input device. This remark concerns all input devices with degrees of freedom number below three.


All NII EOR computer labs and simulators may use by way of input devices:


* virtual gloves
* Trackers and other tracking systems.


Besides considering rather small prevalence of such devices, experts of scientific research institute EOR develop the corresponding methods, allowing to make management of 3D objects, using standard input devices - the keyboard, the mouse.  


**Program complex play** System destination:


The automated development computer simulators “play” system is intended for unification and acceleration of computer creating simulators, using accessible high technologies for today in the given area.


The basic solved system problems are


* Automation of routine operations;
* Development process unification;
* often ready-made objects library use
* own optimized language use


Nowadays the "play-base" incorporated technologies give the fastest and easy way of computer simulators creation.


2. Interactivity and presentation increase of created simulators due to:


* more perfect conclusion schedules technologies(transition from 2D to 3D) use, that, in addition, allows to reduce animation sequences creation time considerably;
* volumetric visualization use(the stereoimage, binocular visualization);
* positioned 3D sound use;
* Opportunities of network technologies use(enables teamwork of end users).


3. The most possible number users' opportunity of using it due to:


* Own optimized script language use instead of the universal language. It is let users without programming experience create the simulators.


4. The granting integration electronic educational content' opportunity into international SCORM and IMS systems' standards.


* SCORM, IMS CP international standards application concerning an electronic educational content granting, allows to build in the created computer simulators in the educational process organization systems, using these standards. It also guarantees reclaiming and opportunity of successful introduction of the created simulators in the near future.
* Cross-platform decisions application allows to use created computer simulators on various hardware platforms and operational systems (MS Windows, Linux, MAC OS, et


Fields of application:


* application software of education functions;
* pedagogical software
* training software
* simulators software
* demonstration software
* modelling software
* Software tool for creation educational purpose programs


Automated system "play" structure:


* The designer of computer simulators "play";
* The expansion module for the program 3D modelling Discreet 3D Studio MAX;
* The expansion module for graphic editor Adobe [PhotoShop?](http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/PhotoShop);
* often used 3D objects library
