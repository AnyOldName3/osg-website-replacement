gvSIG 3D is a extension for visualization and management of three-dimensional views in the GPL software gvSIG. It allows the creation of 3D Views, XYZ-projected as well as spherical (planetary). Local and remote data sources can be loaded as layers on it, and be displayed using most of the options available in 2D-gvSIG like transparency, labeling, legends, etc.


Features


* 3D object layer type.
* 3D Point Clouds.
* 3D navigation tools.
* Force north orientation.
* Zoom to layer or zoom All.
* Interactive layer transparency control.
* 3D Advanced Symbology including 3D objects as a symbol.
* Support for Extrusion legend.
* Advanced visualization tools (Stereoscopy and FullScreen Option).
* 3D model edition.
* cityGML models.
* Selection and Info by point support.
