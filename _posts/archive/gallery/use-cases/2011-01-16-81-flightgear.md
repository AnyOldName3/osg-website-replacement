The FlightGear flight simulator project is an open-source, multi-platform, cooperative flight simulator development project.


The goal of the FlightGear project is to create a sophisticated flight simulator framework for use in research or academic environments, for the development and pursuit of other interesting flight simulation ideas, and as an end-user application. We are developing a sophisticated, open simulation framework that can be expanded and improved upon by anyone interested in contributing.


There are many exciting possibilities for an open, free flight sim. We hope that this project will be interesting and useful to many people in many areas.
